# LetsGo

Creating a web application using ReactJs and DJango as part of a self-initiated project to allow users search places in Singapore for leisure, as well as organise outings with other people using collaborative tools. Data will be taken from the Tourism Info Hub API within the Django framework. A component-based architecture approach is used in the development of the web application.
